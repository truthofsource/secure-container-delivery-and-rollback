# Validation evidence — November 6, 2026

**Terms used here:** A fixture is test data or a test setup used instead of real business records.

The [machine record](validation-results.json) contains source hashes and date. Images come from actual local workbench runs with fictional records.

## Source and fixture boundaries

Read [SOURCE-MAP](SOURCE-MAP.md). Original selected tests remain distinct from new public fixture tests and the earlier portable demonstration. No Azure identity, permission, network path, provider action or current production recovery was exercised. The secret scan does not establish that every dependency/container is vulnerability-free. No new cloud resource, paid operation or Actions run was used.

Historical implementation/acceptance descriptions are source-runbook summaries, not new receipts. PostgreSQL scripts are actual operational helpers; only source inspection and mocked inventory behavior were checked here. No current PostgreSQL restore is claimed. The backup project's fake wrap/unwrap is not cryptographic acceptance.

## Reproduce

Use [the command reference](COMMANDS.md), then inspect expected positive and negative cases. Cloud commissioning, live restores, exact release authorization and trusted scanner/signature evidence remain separate from these offline fixtures.
